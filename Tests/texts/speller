The Spelling Chequer (or poet tree without mist takes)

  Eye have a spelling chequer 
  It came with my pea sea 
  It plainly marks four my revue 
  Miss steaks eye cannot see

  Each thyme when I have struct the quays 
  Eye weight four it two say 
  If watt eye rote is wrong or rite 
  It shows me strait a weigh

  As soon as a mist ache is maid 
  It nose bee fore too late 
  And eye can put the error rite 
  Eye really fined it grate

  I’ve run this poem threw it 
  I’m sure your policed to no 
  It’s letter perfect in its weigh 
  My chequer tolled me sew
